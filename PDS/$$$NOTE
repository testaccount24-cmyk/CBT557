Sam,

Here's a good attachment.  Interested people can use the Soundex
code for all sorts of things with regard to databases and file
searching.  I am using this code as a sample in the ISPF Debugging
series that I am doing right now in the magazine.  Haven't got a
lot of requests for it but I have sent it off to the webmaster at
naspa.  Anyway, try it out and notice the code that it returns for
your last name.  Most U.S. states use the ANNN Soundex code to
begin their driver's license number.
